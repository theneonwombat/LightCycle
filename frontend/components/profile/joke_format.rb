I saw a sign: "Rest Area 25 Miles". Thats pretty big. Some people must be really tired.

A cop stopped me for speeding. He said, "Why were you going so fast?" I said, "See this thing my foot is on? Its called an accelerator. When you push down on it, it sends more gas to the engine. The whole car just takes right off. And see this thing? This steers it."

Just go down to the end of tired and hang a left." So I went down to the end of tired, and just out of curiosity I hung a right. My mother was there, and she said "I thought I told you to go to sleep."

I hate it when my foot falls asleep during the day because that means its going to be up all night.

When I woke up this morning my girlfriend asked me, "Did you sleep well?" I said, "No, I made a few mistakes."

I was trying to daydream, but my mind kept wandering.

One night I walked home very late and fell asleep in somebodys satellite dish. My dreams were showing up on TVs all over the world.

I got up one morning and couldnt find my socks, so I called Information. She said, "Hello, Information." I said, "I cant find my socks." She said, "Theyre behind the couch." And they were!

I went into this bar and sat down next to a pretty girl. She looked at me and said, "Hey, you have two different colored socks on." I said, "Yeah, I know, but to me theyre the same because I go by thickness."

I bought a self learning record to learn Spanish. I turned it on and went to sleep; the record got stuck. The next day I could only stutter in Spanish.

I was going to tape some records onto a cassette, but I got the wires backwards. I erased all of the records. When I returned them to my friend, he said, "Hey, these records are all blank."

Last year I went fishing with Salvador Dali. He was using a dotted line. He caught every other fish.

Theres a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore looking like an idiot.

I bought a dog the other day...I named him Stay. Its fun to call him... "Come here, Stay! Come here, Stay!" He went insane. Now he just ignores me and keeps typing.

I put contact lenses in my dogs eyes. They had little pictures of cats on them. Then I took one out and he ran around in circles.
